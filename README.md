OFF LINE FUNCTIONALITIES

User Story
AS AN avid traveler
I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling 
Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a budget tracker without an internet connection
WHEN the user inputs an expense or deposit
THEN they will receive a notification that they have added an expense or deposit

THEN the deposits or expenses added while they were offline are added to their transaction history and their totals are updated.


Description
Considering the need to keep things, our MVP begins with helping the user keep a budget.
Especially when traveling, budgets are hard to maintain. Being able to visualize your cash flow can help you stay on track.
Furthermore, the ability to continue to keep tabs on spending while off the beaten path without internet service helps the remote worker or traveler.
The best aspect of the code presented is that it is set up to expand into several different "keeps".
